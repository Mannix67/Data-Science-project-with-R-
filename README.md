# Data-Science-project-with-R-
Data Science Project using R


This project requires you to:
1. Read in the datasets from files.
a. Use R to read in the datasets provided.
2. Clean, process and transform the data.
a. Analyse the data to determine its quality. 
b. Take steps to address any missing data, incorrect data, etc. 
c. Determine how/if the data should be transformed before fitting any regression 
model.
3. Implement a number of regression algorithms in R.
a. You should implement the following 2 regression algorithms on all datasets. 
i. Linear regression. 
ii. k-NN. 
b. For each dataset, determine which variables you should include in your regression 
models.
4. Evaluate the performance of each algorithm.
a. Perform a k fold cross validation.
b. Calculate the average k fold MAE, MSE, MAPE and RMSE for each algorithm on both 
the training and test data set.
5. Compare the prediction accuracy of each algorithm on each dataset.
a. Define your null hypothesis.
b. Use statistical testing to compare the test accuracy of each algorithm on each 
dataset and determine if the null hypothesis should be kept or rejected.
6. Write the results to a .csv file.
a. These should include the training and test data prediction accuracy metrics for all 
algorithms across all datasets.
